# Lowework Solution
This repository contains solutions to any CS related student questions that I find to be worth my effort.

Students are free to use this solution repository as a resource, but are discouraged from copying the solutions. Do not remove any license information and misrepresent my work as anyone else's but my own, as that would be plagiarism. Teachers should also use this repository as a bait for students who think they can get away with not learning the material.

My solutions may contain elements that normally would not be taught to students. This increases the chances that a plagiarizing student will be caught by graders. If a student knows how to rework my solution such that the graders would not notice that the solution was copied from me, then the student was probably proficient enough such that working on the homework from scratch would have been a waste of their time.

I will answer random questions I find online that are written by students who haven't attempted to do the work. I will always make sure to archive their post on archive.org and archive.is, work up a solution to their question, then post the whole package in this repository.

This repository will cover C, C++, and Java.

## Questions and Answers
> As a student, I don't understand why you did X. Could you teach me?
No. Read your assigned book or attend the lectures you paid for.

> I tried to test out your solution but your solution is wrong. Could you fix your solution?
Make an issue and let me know how the answer is wrong.

> I am an expert in X subject, your solution is badly written, and industry would never approve of how it is written.
This is a repository for students, not industry experts.

> Can I make solution requests? How much payment do you accept for solutions?
I don't take requests, unless under certain circumstances. I also don't accept payment of any kind for solutions.

> I found this post on a public forum! Can I share with you the link?
No. There is a possibility that you are also the poster trying to make a request in secret.

> This question is on my teacher's public website and they are reusing this question every semester or year. Can I make a request?
Yes. If the teacher is always reusing a question, then I would love to be nothing more than a nuisance who forces them to write a new question.

> This question is on my teacher's public website, but it requires resources internal to the school. Can I make a request?
No.

> This question is privately hosted by my teacher. Can I make a request?
No.

> Do you provide solutions for book questions?
Not if the solution is public.

> There is a huge project I am working on. Could you provide a solution for this project or part of this project?
No. I don't work on huge projects unless they weren't huge project to begin with.

> I finished XX% of the assignment, but have some parts left to do. The current part I am working on is dependent on XX% of the assignment. Can I make a request for the remaining parts?
No. This is an all or nothing endeavor. I am willing to work on parts that are independent of each other, though.

> As the teacher who made question X, I want your solution for X to be removed. Could you do that?
No. If I am already answering your question, chances are that your questions are too old. Make original questions instead.

> I am a teacher. Can I make a request?
No. I don't do jobs that teachers are supposed to do. Plus, if this is some sort of teacher rivalry, then I definitely don't want to get involved.
